Nakhu ukuphawula kwabantu ezinkundleni ngokuxolisa kukaGigaba:     Too many apologies.... Do the country a favour... RESIGN. Enough already — gianicos (@gianicos)

 November 7, 2018       You're an ongoing embarrassment to the @CyrilRamaphosa @GovernmentZA , your @MYANC , our @ParliamentofRSA , your wife and family and to #southafrica in general. #conductunbecoming. You should resign. This is not how cabinet ministers behave.  — Simon Marais (@simonmaraisza) 
 November 7, 2018      Chief resign and go sort yourself out. You will try to make a political comeback in years to come, but for now go morena. Don't be the persona non grata! pic.twitter.com/wX6kK4mrVv — Morolong (@TowardsUhuru)
