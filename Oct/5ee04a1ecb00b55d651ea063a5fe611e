ABANTU bakuleli sebezwakalise ukushaqeka ngendlela ummeli womfundisi obhekene namacala okudlwengula nokushushumbisa abantu besifazane ebandleni lakhe ahlaba ngayo ngemibuzo omunye wofakazi.  UMfundisi Timothy Omotoso ubhekene noxhaxha lwamacala athinta ukudlwengula nokushushumbisa abesifazane abangaphezulu kuka 30 abanye babo abebehlala emzini wakhe oseMhlanga, eThekwini. Usolwa nabesifazane abesibili oNksz Lusanda Sulan noNksz Zukiswa Sitho abasolwa ngokuba abasizi bakhe. Oyedwa walaba besifazane, uNksz Cheryl Zondi (22), ungufakazi wokuqala kuleli cala elivezwa bukhoma kwithelevishini.  UNksz Zondi ukhethe ukuphumela obala ngoba uthe ufuna umhlaba wazi ukuthi uwumuntu onjani uMfundisi Omotoso weJesus Dominion International Church. Kusukela ngoMsombuluko uNksz Zondi uhlatshwa ngemibuzo ummeli ka-Omotoso uMnuz Peter Daubermann. Indlela lo mmeli abeka ngayo imibuzo yakhe isithole ukugxekwa okukhulu ezinkundleni zokuxhumana njengoba abantu abaningi sebezwakalise ukuzwelana noNksz Zondi. Phakathi kwemibuzo eshaqe abaningi ummeli ubuze uNksz Zondi ukuthi mude kangakanani umphambili ka-Omotoso.

 October 15, 2018        #OmotosoTrial Duh! It's POWER RELATIONS. A pastor & a teenager are not equals. Saying "YES" or "OK" to a person of authority, who can decide her fate IS NOT consent. A groomer & his victim are NOT equals. A catholic priest & a little boy who doesn't fight him off are NOT equals  ‚Äî Redi Tlhabi (@RediTlhabi) 
 October 16, 2018        Peter Daubermann is shameless, disgusting and despicable. Can he feel our collect anger at his line of questioning of a rape survivor. May NO woman, morally conscious man, government department or business employ his services from hence forth @tumisole #OmotosoTrial #CherylZondi  ‚Äî Tsepiso Shuenyane (@Tsepi_Shuenyane) 
 October 16, 2018        Tim Omotoso's Lawyer tried so hard to make it seem like a 14-year-old Cheryl Zondi pursued a man old enough to be her father and that she gave consent to be raped. That's how far some people can go to protect rapists. It's a sick world. Nevertheless, he failed ‚úä #OmotosoTrial  ‚Äî üëëuNdlunkulu (@uNdlunkulu_Xoli) 
 October 15, 2018        I was there and did nothing. #TimothyOmotoso raped those girls and I never believed them. Because a man of God is not for such but today I truly wish I had a gun in those days to shoot him for what he kept doing to our friends and sisters. This is my True story. #OmotosoTrial pic.twitter.com/NsYl2MsKL8  ‚Äî Thanduxolo Jindela (@Ian_Jindela) 
 October 16, 2018        This #OmotosoTrial is making my blood boil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is too much. She‚Äôs the victim. Not the perpetrator, yet she is on trial here. So painful to watch  ‚Äî Liezl van der Merwe (@Liezl_vdMerwe) 
 October 16, 2018        As the #OmotosoTrial brings more of this monsters victims to the stand, please can we understand that not all of them will have Cheryl Zondi‚Äôs levels of clarity & strength. That they may not be as resolute or firm does not make them any less credible. We still believe them.  ‚Äî marang setshwaelo (@marangdream)
